Reminder: 
- All the functionailties that you can't find in the obvious customer 
  and teller menus are built in to the customer's engagement with the 
  program (including "Lock", "Unlock", "Making new accounts", "Deleting 
  accounts").

- There is no "Loading banks from file" and "Save bank to file" 
  functionailties mainly because I have a "Random accounts creation" 
  algorithm.

- The sorting algorithm is a whole new algorithm I made completely on 
  my own. It is similar to the sub-region sort I came up with during
  the "create your own sort" assignment. It took me over 20 hours to 
  make, which is kind ridiculous, but you know, I have bad OCD, so...
